# Genetic-algorithm__NodeJS

It is a base of genetic algorihm in node js.
The plan is to create some boilerplate for genetic algorihm, which can generate given number of population and can return **n** best results for every generations.

You can try it if you have installed node on your computer and then:</br>
`npm install`</br>
`npm start`
